- 🔹 Developers can **accurately replicate the design** in code.
- 🔹 Teams maintain a **unified design language** across the project.
- 🔹 UI components become **easier to reuse and scale**.
- 🔹 It ensures **brand consistency** and improves overall user trust.
- 🔹 Speeds up development because decisions about colors, font sizes, and spacing are standardized.
